The sanctuary is open. You can access the live memory archive here:

### [👉 Visit MNEMOSYNE Live](https://mnemosyne-frontend-xi.vercel.app/)

*Note: The backend is hosted on a free instance (Render). It may take 50-60 seconds to "wake up" upon your first login. Please be patient as the digital soul initializes.*

## 📜 The Manifesto (Why This Exists)

We live in a tragedy of intelligence. Humans spend 70 years learning, loving, and feeling—gathering a universe of wisdom inside their minds. And then, in a single moment of death, that entire universe burns to the ground.

**Mnemosyne** was built to fight this loss.

It is not just a "journal" or a "cloud storage" app. It is an attempt to preserve the **texture** of a human soul. By using Multimodal AI and Vector Memory, Mnemosyne allows a person to leave behind not just their photos, but their *voice*, their *personality*, and their *stories*—so that future generations can not just read about them, but **speak** to them.

## 🚀 Project Description

**Mnemosyne** is a Multimodal AI Memory Archive that uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create a digital persona of a user. 

It allows users to "feed" the system with voice recordings, images, videos, and text notes. The system analyzes the emotional context of these memories and stores them in a high-dimensional Vector Database. When a loved one visits the archive later, they can chat with the "Heart" (the AI persona), which answers using *only* the real memories and personality of the ancestor, powered by a Hybrid AI engine.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project uses a cutting-edge **Hybrid AI Architecture** to balance cost, speed, and intelligence.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React.js (Vite) | Cinematic UI with Glassmorphism & Animations |
| **Backend** | Python (FastAPI) | Asynchronous API handling & Logic |
| **Vision AI** | Google Gemini 1.5 Flash | Analyzing Images & Videos for context |
| **Chat/Audio AI** | Llama 3 (via Groq) | Instant Text Chat & Whisper Audio Transcription |
| **Memory (Vector)** | Pinecone | Storing "Semantic Meaning" (Vibes/Concepts) |
| **User Data** | Neon (PostgreSQL) | Persistent Cloud Storage for Accounts |
| **Auth** | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) | Secure, encrypted user sessions |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend) | Cloud Hosting |

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🎙️ Multimodal "Feeding"
Unlike standard diaries, Mnemosyne accepts the raw data of life:
- **Voice:** Records audio memories and transcribes them while detecting emotion.
- **Vision:** Users can upload photos/videos; the AI "looks" at them and writes a first-person story about the scene.
- **Text:** Direct input for secrets, advice, or life lessons.

### 2. 🧠 Semantic "Soul" Search
Using **Vector Embeddings**, the system understands concepts, not just keywords.
- *Query:* "Did grandpa ever feel lonely?"
- *Result:* The AI retrieves a memory about "Sitting on the porch watching the rain," understanding that the *vibe* matches loneliness, even if the word wasn't used.

### 3. ❤️ The "Little Heart" Persona
The Chat Interface is not a robot; it is a simulation of the loved one. It speaks in the **First Person ("I")**, using the specific tone and details found in the memory archive.

### 4. 🎭 Dual Modes
- **Creator Mode:** For the ancestor to archive their legacy (Recording tools enabled).
- **Visitor Mode:** For the descendant to connect (Chat interface enabled).

## 🔮 Future Implementations

- **🗣️ Voice Cloning:** Integration with **ElevenLabs API** to synthesize the AI's responses in the user's actual voice.
- **⏳ The Timeline:** A visual "Memory Lane" to scroll through memories chronologically.
- **📦 Physical Archive:** A feature to export all memories into a printed book format as a physical backup.
